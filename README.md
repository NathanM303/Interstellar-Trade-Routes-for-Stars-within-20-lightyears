This is my dissertation project where I created a code that explores the challenge of calculating the best travel paths between stellar systems within a 20-light-year radius of the Sun. Using data from the GAIA space mission and Wikipedia star catalogues, it studies the position of the stars and generates a map of connected stars based on how far each “hop” between stars can be. By considering their 3D positions in space, Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to find the shortest path between stars
